The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty 
(before 220 A.D.). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the Diamond Sutra
 (British Library) of 868.[4] By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. 
 A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.[5]
